// Answer: markBmiTotall is Greater

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:
//    1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
//    2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
//    versions)
//    3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
//    whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
//    Test data:
//    ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
//    m tall.
//    ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
//    m tall.
